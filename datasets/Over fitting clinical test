#CODE FOR TESTING OF OVER FITTING IN CLINCIAL
(when running at start have to include clinical KNN code)

# Get training accuracy

print("Clinical Dataset - Classification Report on Test Set:\n", classification_report(Y_test, Y_test_pred))

# Check for overfitting: If training accuracy >> testing accuracy, there may be overfitting
if train_accuracy > test_accuracy + 0.1:  # Arbitrary threshold, adjust as needed
